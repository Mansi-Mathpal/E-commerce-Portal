<h4 style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 3920px;">Overview</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 3930px;">Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Me & Mine. However, there may be some cases
where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Me & Mine, we have a Dispute<br> Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.</p>
<h4 style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 3950px;">What is a 'dispute'?</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 3960px;">A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a 
transaction on the Platform.</p>
<h4 style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 3980px;">How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 3990px;">Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes 
arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the <br>resolution of their complaint/issue.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4000px;">It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the 
issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that<br> order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4020px;">How is a 'dispute' created?</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4030px;">Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can contact us through this link https://www.
Me & Mine.com/helpcentre, while the Seller can write to ss@Me & Mine.com, in order to raise a<br> dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.</p>
<h4 style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4050px;">What are the various types of 'disputes'?</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4060px;">Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4070px;">Wrong item received;</li>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4080px;">Item not as described;</li>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4090px;">Damaged or seal broken on Product;</li>

</ul>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4160px;">In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then 
Me & Mine will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute<br> is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product
is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4330px;">If the Buyer has already initiated chargeback through the credit card issuing bank, it will not
be covered under Buyer Protection Program, though in such cases a Seller can file a <br>claim through the Seller Protection Program.</p>

any nature whatsoever that may be incurred by any Buyer/Seller.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4400px;">Claims of the nature of 'Buyer remorse' (i.e. instances where products are bought by the Buyer 
by mistake or where the Buyer chooses to change his/her mind with regard to the <br>product purchased by him) will not be entertained through this program.</p>

<h4 style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4470px;">Disputes via Chargeback</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4480px;">Whenever a chargeback (CB) comes from a payment gateway/bank, following situations may arise:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4490px;">Item not received CB - Buyer hasn't received the item. Refund will be created in accordance

  accordance with the dispute policies.</li>
</ul>

responsibility of the Seller. Furthermore, Seller shall ensure that invoices state "Powered <br>by Me & Mine" and failing to do so Seller will be liable for chargebacks 
(as applicable).</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4520px;">Item not as described - meaning item is not what Buyer expected. Dispute will be decided in 
  accordance with the dispute policies.</li>

<h4 style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4750px;">Me & Mine Infringement Verification (FIV) - Reporting Listing Violations</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4760px;">Me & Mine has put in place Me & Mine Infringement Verification process so that intellectual 
property owners could easily report listings that infringe their rights. It is in Me & Mine's interest<br> to ensure that infringing products are removed from the site, as 
they erode Buyer and good Seller trust.</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4770px;">If you are a Verified Rights Owner and want to report a listing issue, see Me & Mine's FIV. 
  Note: Only the intellectual property rights owner can report potentially infringing products<br> or listings through FIV. If you are not the intellectual property 
  rights owner, you can still help by getting in touch with the rights owner and encouraging them to contact us.</li>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4780px;">If your listing was removed through FIV, and you believe that your listing was removed in 
  error, please contact us.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4790px;">Me & Mine does not and cannot verify that Sellers have the right or ability to sell or 
distribute their listed products. However, Me & Mine is committed to removing infringing or unlicensed <br>products once an authorized representative of the rights owner 
properly reports them to Me & Mine.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4800px;">FIV works to ensure that item listings do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other 
intellectual property rights of third parties. FIV participants have the ability to identify <br>and request removal of allegedly infringing products and materials.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4810px;">Any person or company who holds intellectual property rights (such as a copyright, trademark or
patent) which may be infringed upon by products listed on Me & Mine is encouraged <br>to become a FIV member.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4820px;">Program membership entitles you (Verified Rights Owner) to the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4830px;">Rapid response by Me & Mine in ending listings reported by you (as the Verified Rights Owner)
  as allegedly infringing</li>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4840px;">Dedicated priority email queues for reporting alleged infringements</li>
  <li style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4850px;">The ability to obtain identifying information about Me & Mine's users'</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4870px;">How to Become a FIV Member</h4>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4880px;">To join the FIV, we require only that you fully complete and email Us a Notice of Infringement 
form specifying the allegedly infringing listings and the infringed work, complete with<br> an original authorized signature. The information requested by the Notice of 
Infringement is designed to ensure that parties reporting products are authorized by the rights owners,<br> and to enable Me & Mine to easily identify the material or 
listing to be ended.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4890px;">In the interest of keeping the process easy and simple, after we receive your first Notice of 
Infringement in hard copy, future notices can be sent to Us by email at ss@Me & Mine.com.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4900px;">Note: In your notice of infringement, you shall be required to identify the individual listing
which is infringing your intellectual property. General notices shall not be accepted.</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px; position: relative; left: 50px; top: 4910px;">We are happy to receive such information, but must advise that we may be limited in Our ability
to respond to your request absent formal notice from an authorized rights owner.</p>
